# PC_pPRS_survival

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) predicting survival in pancreatic cancer (PC) have yet to be defined. We aimed to identify such PRSs by partitioning genetic variants associated with PC using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We clustered differentially expressed pathways from scRNA-seq data of 24 primary PC tumors and 11 control tissues into transcriptional programs. Genetic variants associated with PC from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were mapped to each program, forming program PRSs (pPRSs). These pPRSs were tested for association with 5-year overall survival in independent UK Biobank data.
